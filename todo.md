# AI Enhancement Ideas for FeedWise

## Overview

### 1. Personalized Article Recommendations

Your current relevance scoring system is a good start, but you could enhance it with machine learning to create truly personalized recommendations:

- **Reading Behavior Analysis**: Track which articles users spend the most time on and use that data to recommend similar content
- **Click-Through Analysis**: Analyze which articles users click on to understand their interests better
- **Advanced Relevance Scoring**: Incorporate NLP to understand article content beyond just tags

### 2. Content Summarization

- **AI-Generated Article Summaries**: Provide concise summaries of long articles so users can quickly decide if they want to read the full content
- **Key Points Extraction**: Highlight the most important points from articles

### 3. Smart Content Categorization

- **Automatic Tagging**: Analyze article content to suggest or automatically apply relevant tags
- **Topic Clustering**: Group related articles together even if they come from different feeds
- **Content Classification**: Automatically categorize content by type (news, tutorial, opinion, etc.)

### 4. Smart Search and Filtering

- **Semantic Search**: Allow users to search using natural language and find conceptually related articles
- **Content Filter Suggestions**: "You might also be interested in..." based on current filters

### 5. User Experience Enhancements

- **Reading Time Estimates**: Show estimated reading times for articles
- **Readability Scores**: Rate articles by complexity/readability
- **Content Quality Scoring**: Rate sources by credibility and content quality
- **Reading Queue Suggestions**: "Read this next" based on current interests and time available

### 6. Notification Intelligence

- **Priority Notifications**: Only alert users about the most relevant articles
- **Best Time to Read**: Suggest optimal times for reading based on user habits
- **Interest Shifts**: Alert users when the system detects a change in their interests
